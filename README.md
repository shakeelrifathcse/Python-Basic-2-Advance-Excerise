# Python Basics Practice Problems

This repository contains a collection of basic Python programming problems organized by topic. Each topic contains multiple problems that can help reinforce fundamental programming concepts.

## Table of Contents

#### 1. Introduction to Python
#### 2. Logical Operators (and, or, not)													
#### 3. Relational (Comparison) Operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
#### 4. Bitwise Operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
#### 5. Control Structures (if, elif, else)
#### 6. Loops (for, while)
#### 7. Functions
#### 8. Data Structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)
#### 9. Strings
#### 10. File Handling and exception handling

DEBUGGING SKILL IMPROVEMENT
DATA STRUCTURES ONLY 

#### 11. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
#### 12. Inheritance and Polymorphism
#### 13. Modules and Packages
#### 14. Additional Concepts
- **Basic:**
  - Error handling using try, except, finally blocks (exception handling)
  - Working with command-line arguments using sys.argv
  - Using list comprehensions and generator expressions for concise data processing
- **Intermediate:**
  - Context managers (with statement) for resource management
  - Decorators to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods
  - Generators and iterators for efficient memory usage and lazy evaluation

ALGORITHMS

- **Advanced:**
  - Multi-threading and multiprocessing for concurrent execution of tasks
  - Asynchronous programming using asyncio for non-blocking I/O operations
  - Unit testing with unittest or pytest for automated testing of Python code
